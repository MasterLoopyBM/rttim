Ryno's Toontown Infinite Modifications
================

Mods of Toontown Infinite.  Kinda been in some drama but who cares?  Not me.

What's so special about this?  It has naked Toons, some retro stuff (like retro make-a-toon), classic character transformations, Cog Disguise versatility, TTR's Toon Species, and other stuff.  Much of it has made it to Toontown Offline, but Toontown Offline is an actual project.  This is more of a code playground.

**Before you submit any issues**, check to see if it's already covered in the support booth: https://github.com/rynogg/rttim/wiki/Support-Booth

If you do encounter any issues in-game, I highly recommend trying to fix it yourself by forking the repository and making modifications to the code, then after committing changes create a pull request to import your code to the master.  **Make sure that it works before you try to do any of this**.  I don't want any broken code store.
